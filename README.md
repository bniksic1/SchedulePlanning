In addition, we have activities tab where we can see our dynamically activities depending on actual date i.e. actual day of the week. 

Professor can input new activity or student to be stored in MySQL database. Entered data automatically reflects in the schedule and activities tab, as we said.

A simple frontend implementation, with the help of Bootstrap, provides data nicely structured into schedule and tables for database tab.

The project also contains tests. They are executed with Chai and Mocha packages that read tests in CSV format, parse into pure JS objects and then do their purpose.
